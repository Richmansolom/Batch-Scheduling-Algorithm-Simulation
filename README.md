# Batch-Scheduling-Algorithm-Simulation
This project is a web-based simulation tool for visualizing and comparing classic CPU batch scheduling algorithms â€” FIFO (First In First Out), SJF (Shortest Job First), and SRT (Shortest Remaining Time) â€” using randomly generated process data.
Developed using React and JavaScript, the simulator offers an interactive user interface that demonstrates how different scheduling strategies perform under varying workloads.
Key Features
âœ… Simulates FIFO, SJF, and SRT algorithms

ðŸ”„ Random process data generation with adjustable parameters (arrival time, burst time)

ðŸ“Š Calculates and displays:

Average Turnaround Time (ATT)

d/ATT ratio (normalized efficiency metric)

ðŸ“ˆ Visualizes scheduling flow using Gantt charts

ðŸ§  Built-in statistical analysis under different workload conditions

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Frontend: React, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3

Charts/Graphs: Chart.js or Recharts (optional)

State Management: React Hooks

ðŸ“· Screenshots
Include screenshots of Gantt charts, performance graphs, and simulation dashboard.

ðŸ§  Core Concepts
This simulator is based on fundamental operating systems concepts:

Batch CPU Scheduling

Turnaround Time (TAT)

Preemptive vs. Non-Preemptive Scheduling

Statistical Performance Evaluation
